# vehicles

Project description: This Vehicle Selection and Random Event Simulation App helps users filter and explore vehicles based on their price range and odometer reading, while also simulating random events using custom logic. It also helps users select a vehicle that fits within their specified budget and preference for low mileage.

  Price Range: Use the price range slider to select the minimum and maximum price for the vehicles you are interested in.

  Low Odometer Option: Check the box to filter for vehicles with low mileage (odometer readings below 15,000 miles).

  Visualizations:
  Scatter Plot: Displays a relationship between the vehicle's price and its odometer reading.

  Price Distribution Histogram: Shows the distribution of vehicle prices within the selected range.

  Random Event Simulation: The app incorporates methods for simulating random events, such as choosing vehicles based on random criteria, using Pythonâ€™s built-in random library.

Libraries and Methods Used:

Streamlit: For creating interactive web applications and visualizing data.

Plotly Express: For generating interactive charts, such as scatter plots and histograms.

Pandas: For data manipulation and filtering based on user inputs.

Random (Python library): For simulating random events, such as selecting vehicles randomly within a given price or mileage range.

If other people wanted to launch the app on their local machine they would need to clone git repository through VS Code using the https url and then they can launch it locally.
